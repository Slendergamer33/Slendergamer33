## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a tech-driven problem solver with a deep interest in finance, automation, and scalable software. Currently building **NextStepAI** to help startups streamline hiring through AI-powered WhatsApp engagement. I'm also the co-founder of **Givify Ltd**, where we achieved **$10K+ in first-month sales** with minimal paid marketing.

Outside of academics, I run a **1K+ member trading group**, experiment with **Solana-based bots**, and love taking on projects that blend markets, systems, and code.
